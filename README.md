## About Me:

  IÂ´m Emilio Zamarron, I love Martial Arts, coding, listening music, I started to learn how to code since I had 15 years old so I could help my fathers business to grown developing software. As first language I started with Javascript, HTML,CSS (web development) then follow with react and finally node.js and so on (python, bootstrap, C#, etc.)
